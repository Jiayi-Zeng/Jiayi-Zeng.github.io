It does not calculate or store those numbers in memory up front, it calculates them only when they are needed, one at a time.\n\n```python\nmy_range = range(11, 23)\nfor x in my_range:\n    print(x)\n```\n\n## File Object Are Also Iterators\n\nYou may have remembered from the prerequisite course how we opened files and iterated through the lines one at a time. The main takeaway is that each line is read in (iterated through) one at a time.  The entire file is not read up-front, each line is read into this notebook one at a time, as needed.\n\n```python\nfilepath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'AAA_Fuel_Prices.csv')\ncount = 0\nwith open(filepath, 'r') as my_file:\n    for line in my_file:\n        line = line.strip()\n        print(line)\n        count += 1\n        if count > 10:\n            break\n```\n\n## Iterators Can Also Be Made From Lists (as well as other data types)\n\nIterators can also be made out of lists. This is what happens when we use a list in a for loop.\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor x in my_list:\n    print(x)\n```\n\n```python\nmy_list_iterator = iter(my_list)\n\nprint(type(my_list_iterator))\nprint(my_list_iterator.__next__())\nprint(my_list_iterator.__next__())\nprint(my_list_iterator.__next__())\n```\n\n# **Generators**\n\nYou may wonder how can we write functions, like `range()`, that return iterators that we can iterate through. We can!  In order to do so, we must use the keyword `yield` instead of `return`.\n\n## Our Own Version Of Range\n\nLet's write our own version of the `range()` function.  We need to write a function the will yield numbers between a beginning and ending number. Note that when the function reaches the yield keyword, it will return that value (in this case, the value of `i`) and it will cease execution until it is asked for the next value. \n\n```python\ndef my_range(beg, end):\n    \"Generate numbers from start to stop\"\n    i = beg\n    while i < end:\n        yield i\n        i += 1\n```\n\n```python\n# Let's call the function to return a generator that we can iterate through. \nrange_of_nums = my_range(0, 10)\n\n# Now, let's call the __next__() method to get each value is the it is \n# \"yielded\" by the generator\n\n# This executes the code in the generator until it hits the yield statement.  It then stops until __next__() is called again.\nprint(range_of_nums.__next__())\nprint(range_of_nums.__next__())\nprint(range_of_nums.__next__())\n```\n**output:**\n\n```\n0\n1\n2\n```\n\nWe do not usually use the `__next__()` method directly. We are usually looping over the iterator, or passing the iterator to another iterative process (in these case,`__next__()` is still used \"under the hood\", but we are not using it directly as programmers). Below, we simple use `range_of_nums` in a loop, we also use the `my_range()` function directly in a for loop, just like you would use `range()`.\n\n```python\nfor num in my_range(30, 33):\n    print(num)\n```\n\n## **A Fibonacci Series Generator.**\n\nA Fibonacci Series is a series of numbers in which the next number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.  If we start with 0 and 1, then the series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.  This is a fun series that is often used in computer science lessons. Let's code a function that will return a generator that iterates through the Fibonacci Series (starting with 0 and 1).\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_series(N):\n    \"\"\"Generate the Fibonacci series starting at 0 and 1\"\"\"\n    # We start by seeding 0 and 1 as the first two numbers\n    i_prev = 0\n    i = 1\n    yield i_prev  # we yield 0 first\n    # now in the following loop, we yield \"i\" and then calculate i_next by\n    # summing the two previous\n    for _ in range(N-1):\n        yield i \n        i, i_prev = i + i_prev, i\n```\n\n```python\nf_s = fibonacci_series(10)\nfor x in f_s:\n    print(x)\n```\n\n**Iterators Can Only Be Iterated Over Once**\n\nOnce we create an iterator, it can only be iterated over once.  For example, in the above cell we looped over the entirety of `f_s`.  Below, we try to loop over it again, but nothing prints. This is because we have already looped over the iterator to its end.  If we need to iterate again, we will have to create a new iterator.\n\n## File Word Counts\n\nAnother example, which will become more meaningful if you take the course Python Data Structures, Data Mining and Big Data, is producing a word counts from a file, line by line.\n\nLet's write a function that will generate word counts, from a file, line by line.\n\n```python\ndef file_word_count(filepath):\n    \"\"\"Generate word counts from ta file, line by line\"\"\"\n    # First, open the file\n    with open(filepath, 'r') as my_file:\n        # Loop through the lines\n        for line in my_file:\n            line = line.strip()  # strip whitespace from the line\n            words = line.split()  # split the line into words\n            # create a dictionary that we will store the word counts in\n            word_count_dict = {}\n            # loop through the words in the line and tally them in the\n            # dictionary\n            for word in words:\n                if word in word_count_dict:\n                    word_count_dict[word] += 1\n                else:\n                    word_count_dict[word] = 1\n            # now loop through the dictionary and yield up the word counts \n            for word in word_count_dict:\n                yield word, word_count_dict[word]\n```\n\n```python\naesopa10_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'aesopa10.txt')\ncounter = 0\nfor word, count in file_word_count(aesopa10_path):\n    print(word, count)\n    counter += 1\n    if counter > 2000:\n        break\n```\n\n# **Enumerate and Zip**\n\n## Enumerate\n\nEnumerate takes in an iterable object (like a list, tuple, or some other iterator) and outputs tuples that are enumerated. The first element in the tuple is the number and the second is the value from the original iterable object.\n\n```python\nmy_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nfor item in enumerate(my_list):\n    print(item)\n```\n\n```\n(0, 'a')\n(1, 'b')\n(2, 'c')\n```\n\n## Zip\n\nZip will take multiple iterable objects as inputs and output tuples that contain items from each iterable, in order. That is the first tuple will contain the first item from each iterable, the second tuple will contain the second items, etc...\n\n```python\ntuple_1 = (2012, 2012, 2012)\ntuple_2 = ('01', '02', '03')\n\nnew_list = []\nfor val1, val2 in zip(tuple_1, tuple_2):\n    print(val1, val2)\n    new_list.append(str(val1) + '_' + val2)\nprint(new_list)\n```\n\n```\n2012 01\n2012 02\n2012 03\n['2012_01', '2012_02', '2012_03']\n```\n\n```py\nfor x in zip(tuple_1, tuple_2):\n    print(x)\n```\n\n```\n(2012, '01')\n(2012, '02')\n(2012, '03')\n```\n\n","tags":["Python"],"categories":["Immediate to Python"]},{"title":"Functions Positional and Keyword Arguments","url":"/docs/Immediate-to-Python-2-Functions-Positional-and-Keyword-Arguments/","content":"\n# Positional Arguments\n\nThese are argument that are assigned based on their position in the function definition.  A example below will make this clear.\n\n```python\ndef print_greeting(username, date):\n    \"\"\"Print a simple greeting\"\"\"\n    greeting = 'Greetings, {}. The date is {}'.format(username, date)\n    print(greeting)\n```\n\n```python\n# test the function\nprint_greeting('Ronda', '2019-01-01')\n```\n\nWhy did the function treat 'Ronda' as the username argument and '2019-01-01' as the date argument? The answer is simple: it is because 'Ronda' was the first argument passed to the function and, in the function definition, username is the first argument in the function signature.\n\nThe arguments are assigned by *position*.\n\n# Keyword Arguments\n\nKeyword arguments are arguments that are passed to a function by the argument name.  For example, when calling the `print_greeting` function we can pass the arguments as shown in the cell below.\n\n```python\nmy_name = \"Will\"\ntoday = \"2019-07-01\"\nprint_greeting(date=today, username=my_name)\n\nprint_greeting(username=\"Padma\", date=\"2019-03-01\")\n```\n\n**Sometimes you can't use keyword to specify arguments, and sometimes you can only use keywords to specify certain arguments.**\n\nMany built in Python function are implemented in C and use a position-only API for processing argument. That means that there are some function with arguments that can not be specified by keyword. \n\n```python\nhelp(sorted)\n```\n\n![image-20230301180010676](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230301180010676.png)\n\nNotice the `/` in the function signature above?  This indicates that all the argument to the left of it can ONLY be specified by position. That is you can not pass the 'iterable' argument by keyword. (You may notice the `*` in the signature as well, we will discuss that in a moment)\n\n```python\nmy_list = [2, 3, 1]\n\n# We incorrectly try to pass the iterable argument by keyword. This will produce an error\n\n# We correctly pass the iterable argument by position\nsorted_list = sorted(my_list)\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nNow, what about the `*` in the function signature? This means that you can ONLY specify the arguments to the right of it by keyword.  For example, in the sorted function, the arguments `key` and `reverse` can only be specified by keywords. See an example below:\n\n```python\nmy_list = ['a_3', 'b_2', 'c_1']\n\nsorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=lambda x: x.split('_')[-1])\n\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\n# Introducing *args\n\nNow, take your mind back to positional arguments.  What if you want a function to accept unlimited positional arguments? This is what the `*args` argument can do. By using the `*args` argument in our function definition, all positional arguments will be collected in a **tuple** named `args`. Let's define a function below using the `*args` argument to see how this works\n\n```python\ndef args_example(*args):\n    '''Print the contents of args.'''\n    print(args)\n    \nargs_example('Miguel', 'Mary', 'Paul')\n# Output: ('Miguel', 'Mary', 'Paul')\n```\n\n## Combining \\*args with other positional arguments.\n\nYou can have positional arguments *before* `*args`. `*args` will collect all the extra position arguments passed to the function.\n\n```python\ndef print_all_the_greetings_2(greeting, *args):\n  '''Print \"{greeting}, {name} for the greeting and all the names passed as arguments\n\t'''\n\tfor name in args:\n\t\tprint(\"{}, {}\".format(greeting, name))\n        \nprint_all_the_greetings_2('Good Morning', 'Winston', 'Aarav', 'Julie')\n```\n\n# Introducing \\*\\*kwargs\n\nMuch like `*args` captures extra positional arguments, `**kwargs` captures extra keyword arguments in a dictionary called `kwargs`.\n\n```python\ndef kwargs_example(**kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Print kwargs\"\"\"\n    print(kwargs)\n    \nkwargs_example(name=\"Paloma\", occupation='teacher')\n```\n\n# Mixing Positional and Keyword Arguments.\n\nWhen using both positional and keyword arguments you must specify the positional arguments **first**.\n\n```PYTHON\nprint_greeting(username=\"Padma\", date=\"2019-03-01\")\n\nprint_greeting(\"Padma\", date=\"2019-03-01\")\n```\n\n## Mixing Positional Arguments, \\*args, Keyword Arguments and \\*\\*kwargs\n\n```python\ndef test_arg_and_kwarg(arg1, arg2, *args, kwarg1, kwarg2, **kwargs):\n    print(arg1)\n    print(arg2)\n    print(args)\n    print(kwarg1)\n    print(kwarg2)\n    print(kwargs)\n    return\n\ntest_arg_and_kwarg(1, 2, 'extra_1', 'extra_2', kwarg1='kwarg 1',\n                   kwarg2='kwarg 2', extra_kwarg1='Bonus!',\n                  extra_kwarg2=\"I'm extra!\")\n```\n\n# Default Arguments\n\nSometimes you want to specify a default argument value to one of the arguments in your function. This means that if no value is passed to that specific argument, it will still have a default value and the function will run successfully.\n\nThis is very common. In fact, let's look at the documentation for the built in function `sorted` again.\n\nSee the 'key=None' and the 'reverse=False' in the function signature? This indicates that the default value for key is None, and the default value for reverse is False. This means that if we use the sorted function, these will be the values for these arguments if we do not specify other values.\n\n```python\nhelp(sorted)\n\n# Output:\nHelp on built-in function sorted in module builtins:\n\nsorted(iterable, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)\n    Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.\n    \n    A custom key function can be supplied to customize the sort order, and the\n    reverse flag can be set to request the result in descending order.\n```\n\n## You can use \\* and \\*\\* to pass arguments to functions.\n\nJust as we used the \\* and \\*\\* to collection arguments that are passed to a function, you can also use the to pass arguments to a function from a tuple or dictionary.  Let's walk through two examples below.\n\n```python\ndef my_function(x, y):\n    result = x**2-y**(0.5)\n    return result\n    \n# Here we use the function and pass the values directly\nresult1 = my_function(2.1, 0.6)\n\n# Belww, we define a tuple with the values, and then pass those values to the\n# function by indexing them from the tuple.\nvalues = (2.1, 0.6)\nresult2 = my_function(values[0], values[1])\n\n# Here, we just use the '*' to dump the arguments in the values tuple directly\n# to the function\nresult3 = my_function(*values)\n\n# Finally, print all three results so that we ensure all methods give the same\n#result\nprint(result1, result2, result3)\n```\n\n```python\ndef my_greeting(date, greeting):\n    print('{}: {}'.format(date, greeting))\n    \n# Here we use the function and pass the values directly\nmy_greeting('2018-11-07', \"How are you today?\")\n\n# Below, we define a tuple with the values, and then pass those values to the\n# function by indexing them from the tuple.\nmy_greeting(greeting='How are you today?', date='2018-11-07')\n\n# Here, we just use the '*' to dump the arguments in the values tuple directly\n# to the function\nvalues = {'greeting': 'How are you today?', 'date': '2018-11-07'}\nmy_greeting(**values)\n```\n\n# An example of a built-in function that actually uses `args` and `kwargs`!\n\nNow, let's look at a built-in functions that uses both `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nThe function is the `format` method of string objects.  Depending on which version of the prerequisite course you have taken, you may have already seen this, but we will do a quick review anyways.\n\n## The .format() method of a string object.\n\nOne of the preferred methods to format strings in Python is to use the format method of string objects. (The latest preferred method is something called 'f strings'). Observe the example below.  First, we define a string and we put `{}` in the string wherever we would like to fill in the string by a variable. We then call the `.format()` method on the string and pass to it the variables we would like to use to fill in the `{}` portions of the string.  The `{}` are filled in by the order we pass the variables to the `.format()` method.\n\n```python \nmy_string = 'Hi, my name is {}. I live in {} and I work at {}'.format('Will', 'California', 'UCI')\nprint(my_string)\n```\n\nThe point here is that `.format()` can accept *any* number of arguments, it just depend how many `{}` we have to fill in in the string.  How does `.format()` do this? It uses the `*args` argument to capture all of the positional arguments passed, and then it fills in the `{}` in the order of the arguments.\n\n## The .format() method also uses kwargs!\n\nFormat also supports keywords, observe the example below:\n\n```python\nmy_string = 'Hi, my name is {name}. I live in {home} and I work at {work}'. \\\n    format(name='Will', home='California', work='UCI')\nprint(my_string)\n```","tags":["Python"],"categories":["Immediate to Python"]},{"title":"6 Regression Quality","url":"/docs/Predicted-Analytics-4-Regression-Quality/","content":"\nMetrics to measure the Quality of Regression \n\n* Correlation between the response variable and predictor variables \n* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) \n* R-square + Adjusted R-Square \n* p-values of the predictor variables \n* Residuals are normally distributed. \n\n# **Linear Regression**","tags":["DSBA","Data Mining"],"categories":["Predicted Analytics: Tools & Techniques"]},{"title":"8 kNN Model","url":"/docs/Predicted-Analytics-6-kNN-Model.md/","content":"\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["DSBA","Data Mining"],"categories":["Predicted Analytics: Tools & Techniques"]},{"title":"7 Multi Variable Regression","url":"/docs/Predicted-Analytics-5-Multi Variable Regression/","content":"\n\n\n\n","tags":["DSBA","Data Mining"],"categories":["Predicted Analytics: Tools & Techniques"]},{"title":"9 Data Pre Dis","url":"/docs/Predicted-Analytics-7-DataPrep-Discreditization+OneHot Encoding/","content":"\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["DSBA","Data Mining"],"categories":["Predicted Analytics: Tools & Techniques"]},{"title":"5 Linear Regression","url":"/docs/Predicted-Analytics-3.2-Linear-Regression/","content":"\n*Linear regression* *analysis* is a widely used statistical technique used to explore relationships among continuous variables. In addition, this technique can be applied to categorical variables through the use of dummy variables.\n\nThere are many situations where linear regression is useful. For instance,\n\n- A market researcher can use regression to determine which one of several media markets is the best on which to spend their advertising dollars;\n- In business, regression can be used to predict a competitive salary offer for a programmer with a given number of years of experience;\n- In Major League Baseball, regression can be used to predict the salaries of free agents;\n- In social science research, regression can predict a wide range of phenomena—from economic performance to college enrollment.\n\n# **Simple Linear Regression**\n\n*Simple linear regression* refers to the statistical relationship between a dependent continuous variable, say *y*, and a single independent continuous variable, say *x*. This relationship takes the form of an equation that lets us predict values of *y* given values of *x*. Regression equations are useful for estimating new data values or exploring “what if” questions.\n\nAs an example of simple linear regression, suppose you survey a group of workers and notice that those who have more years of education tend to have received higher starting salaries when they began working. A linear regression analysis allows you to quantify the relationship between starting salary and years of education through an equation that you can then use to make predictions about starting salaries for other individuals. \n\nLinear regression analysis allows you to (1) determine whether one or more continuous (independent) variables can effectively predict the values of an outcome (dependent) variable and (2) quantify the impact that each independent variable has on that outcome variable.\n\nThe relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable can be visualized using a scatter plot, as shown in Figure 1, below. The figure shows a set of data points along with the “best-fit” line that results from a regression analysis of that data.\n\n![A simple scatter with Fit Line of Cred card debt in the thousands by Household income in thousands showing the relationship between credit card debt and household income.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/8z2gseSWiCfo4OvgpV_tyZr16er1sl1k6bsCGtrVhCrH8DrIRl3Jz4zaXHG7FmUiUiGqhjLPxpJXNjleOFdQP-8SW78yLrc_XzCSzZKO7wiBI7OFv7z-PCZ9VCRBgqkjM9weT-_CqN1WgquKbimuQA)\n\n*Figure 1: A scatter plot showing the relationship between credit card debt (in thousands) and household income (also in thousands)*\n\nThe line is represented in general form by the equation \n\n$$\ny = bx+a\n$$\n\nwhere *b* is the slope (the change in *y* per unit change in *x*) and *a* is the intercept (the value of *y* when *x* is zero). People are usually more interested in the slope than in the intercept. Also, note that *a* and *b* depend on the unit of measurement of the variables and, as such, do not necessarily indicate anything about the strength of the relationship.\n\nAs you can see, the data points don’t necessarily fall on this line, so it’s important to evaluate how well the line actually represents the data. To determine this, we start by looking at the *correlation* between the *x* and *y* values, and calculating a *correlation coefficient, r,* to quantify this relationship. Because the correlation coefficient can take on negative values and we prefer to work with only positive values, we typically square it (*r**2*) and refer to it as *R-squared.* This quantity lies on a scale from 0 (no linear association) to 1 (perfect linear association), and can be interpreted as the proportion of variation in one variable that can be predicted from the other. Thus an R-squared of 0.5 indicates that you can account for 50% of the variance in one variable if you knew the values of the other variable. Think of this value as a measure of the improvement in your ability to predict one variable from the other (or others if there are multiple independent variables).\n\nWhile R-squared provides a good starting point for determining how well your regression equation fits your data, a more rigorous way involves performing *statistical tests* to determine the *statistical significance* of the relationship. A relationship that is statistically significant means that your regression equation can reliably make predictions given new values of the independent variable. In other words, the predictions are more likely to be due to some factor of interest rather than random chance.\n\nReferring to Figure 1, notice that many points fall near the line but some are quite a distance from it. For each point, the difference between the value of the dependent variable and the value predicted by the equation (the value on the line) is called the *residual* (also known as the *error*). Points above the line have positive residuals (the equation under-predicted them), those below the line have negative residuals (the equation over-predicted them), and those points falling on the line have a residual of zero (perfect prediction). Points having relatively large residuals are of interest because they represent instances where the prediction performed poorly. Outliers, or points far from the positions of the other points, are of interest in regression because they can exert a considerable influence on the equation (especially if the sample size is small).\n\nLet’s apply linear regression analysis to an example in which household income is the independent (predictor) variable and credit card debt is the dependent variable. A standard linear regression analysis generates three tables depicting the relationship between the two variables. Here are several key points about the information appearing in those tables:\n\n- The *model summary table* provides several measures of how well the model fits the data (see Table 1).\n- As discussed above, R-squared, which can range from 0 to 1, is the correlation coefficient squared. It can be interpreted as the proportion of variance of the dependent measure that can be predicted from the independent variable(s).\n- The *adjusted R-squared* represents a technical improvement over R-squared in that it explicitly adjusts for the number of predictor variables relative to the sample size. If the adjusted R-squared and R-squared differ dramatically, it is a sign that you have used too many predictor variables for the sample size.\n- The *standard error of the estimate* is a measure of the standard deviation of the residuals. It represents the amount of variation that is not accounted for by the regression line on the scale of the dependent variable.\n\n![image-20230223222504355](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223222504355.png)\n\nWhile the goodness-of-fit measures indicate how well you can expect the regression equation to predict the dependent variable, they do not tell whether there is a statistically significant relationship between the dependent and independent variable(s). For this, we turn to an *analysis of variance* (ANOVA) table, which presents technical summaries (i.e., sums of squares and mean square statistics) of the variation accounted for by the prediction equation (Table 2). The main goal is to determine whether there is a statistically significant (non-zero) linear relation between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s).\n\nThe significance (Sig.) column in the ANOVA table provides the probability that there is no relationship between the dependent and independent variable(s). A zero or nearly zero Sig. value means that the relationship is statistically significant and that you should further investigate the results of the regression coefficients appearing in the Coefficients table (Table 3).\n\n![image-20230223222446131](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223222446131.png)\n\n*Table 2: ANOVA table showing sums of squares, mean squares, and the probability that there is no relationship between dependent and independent variables*\n\nThe first column contains a list of the independent variables plus the intercept (constant). The intercept is the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is 0—it is also *a* in the equation $y=bx+a$.\n\n- The column labeled B contains the estimated regression coefficients you would use in a prediction equation. In this example, the coefficient for household income indicates that on average, each additional unit increase in household income is associated with an increase of 0.030 in credit card debt.\n- The Std. Error column contains standard errors of the regression coefficients. The standard errors can be used to calculate a 95% confidence interval above and below the B coefficients. (This means that statistically, the true value of B will fall within this interval 95% of the time.)\n- Betas are standardized regression coefficients used to judge the relative importance of each of several independent variables.\n- The t statistics provide a significance test for each B coefficient, indicating which predictors are statistically significant.\n\n![image-20230223222431472](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223222431472.png)\n\n*Table 3: A tabulation of statistical information for the coefficients in the regression model relating credit card debt to household income*\n\n# **Multiple Linear Regression**\n\nRegression involving more than one independent variable is called *multiple linear regression* and is a direct extension of simple linear regression. When running a multiple linear regression analysis you are again concerned with fitting a linear model to the data, determining whether any of the variables are significant predictors, and estimating the coefficients of the best-fitting prediction equation. In addition, you are interested in the relative importance of the independent variables in predicting the dependent measure.\n\nContinuing with the previous example, we add age, years with current employer, and having previously defaulted as independent variables to the model, which now explains about 43% of the variance in credit card debt. This is a substantial increase in explanatory power from the 30% we were able to explain with just one predictor variable, namely household income.\n\n![image-20230223222534173](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223222534173.png)\n\n*Table 4: The model summary table for a multiple linear regression*\n\nNot surprisingly, we still have a statistically significant model as shown in the ANOVA table Table 5).\n\n![image-20230223222555334](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223222555334.png)\n\n*Table 5: ANOVA table showing sums of squares, mean squares, and the probability that there is no relationship between dependent and independent variables*\n\nFinally, we can see in Table 6 that all of the variables in the model are statistically significant except age, which means that we can remove this variable from the model. We can also see that household income is the most important predictor, followed by previous defaults, and then years with the current employer. We can use the regression equation that resulted from this analysis to predict someone’s credit card debt as follows:\n\n$$\ncreditCardDebt=0.026(householdIncome)+0.067(yearsWith Employer)+1.627(previouslyDefaulted)-0.721\n$$\n\nNote that “previously defaulted” is a categorical variable, which is coded as a dummy variable in which “no” is 0 and “yes” is 1.\n\n![image-20230223222722318](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223222722318.png)\n\n*Table 6: A tabulation of statistical information for the coefficients in the regression model relating credit card debt to household income, age, years with employer, and previous defaults*\n\n# **Polynomials and Interaction Terms**\n\nThis is an advanced and important topic. It is not true that linear regression can identify only linear relationships. It can handle curvilinear relationships as well if you know how to prepare the data. For instance, if you determined (through visual inspection) that income would predict credit card debt better with a quadratic relationship, you could do the following.\n\n- Create a new variable consisting of income squared\n- Add another coefficient corresponding to the new variable\n\nIt would look like this:\n\n$$\ny=a+b_1x_1+b_2x_1^2\n$$\n\nwhere $x_1$= income and $x_1^2$= income squared.\n\nAnother feature you might uncover through visual inspection is a pair of variables that interact. Here again the solution is to create a new variable. A good indicator that you have an interaction occurring is if the slopes of the regression lines for two groups (e.g., males and females) are different. In our example, this would suggest that the relationship between credit card debt and income is different for people that had previously defaulted on a loan than it is for people that had not previously defaulted on a loan (see Figure 2).\n\nThe resulting regression formula looks like this:\n\n$$\ny=a+b_1x_1+b_2x_2+b_3x_1x_2\n$$\n\nwhere $x_1$= income and $x_2$= previously defaulted. The interaction appears as the product $x_1x_2$.\n\nIf you fail to include the interaction term, the model will mathematically force the lines to be parallel and maintain the same “ gap” over the entire income range. Figure 2 makes it clear that this would not be accurate since the gap is clearly more severe at higher levels of income. Polynomials and interaction terms can seem tricky and abstract at first, but they are critical for understanding neural networks, which will be presented in a later module.\n\n![A simple scatter with

Modeling","url":"/docs/Predicted-Analytics-2.1-Introduction-to-Predictive-Modeling/","content":"\nData analysis involves a number of modeling techniques that can be classified as three main types:\n\n- Predictive\n- Clustering\n- Association\n\n# **Predictive Modeling**\n\n*Predictive modeling*, sometimes called ***supervised learning***, focuses on understanding or making predictions about a given variable based on one or more other variables. **The ultimate goal of predictive analysis is accuracy**. For example, you may want to predict which potential customers are more likely to apply for a credit card based on a knowledge of their demographic and financial information. In this scenario, there are two types of variables:\n\n- **The** **dependent variable** **or** **target**: The variable you are trying to predict or understand (i.e., the likelihood of applying for a credit card)\n- **The** **independent variables** **or predictors**: The variables you are using as a basis for predicting or understanding the target variable (i.e., demographic and financial information)\n\nBelow are several additional applications of predictive modeling:\n\n- Determining which students in a class will pass or fail\n- Predicting which parts of a city will experience increasing crime (predictive policing)\n- Forecasting the number of unfilled hotel rooms three months from now\n- Projecting which patients are likely to have a heart attack\n- Estimating how much each customer will purchase when shopping online\n- Classifying shipping containers according to the likelihood that they carry drugs or weapons\n- Identifying IP addresses that are sending unusual amounts of information\n\n# **Cluster Analysis**\n\nCluster analysis, or segmentation, is a type of unsupervised learning problem that is very different from predictive modeling. Cluster analysis is appropriate when you can associate each case in a dataset with other cases that share similar distinct characteristics. You end up with several groups, in which the members of each group are very similar to each other but very different compared to members of other groups.\n\nCluster analysis is often used in marketing campaigns so that customers receive ads tailored for the group to which they belong rather than generic ads. These groups are identified via cluster analysis. In such a scenario, there is no dependent variable; only independent variables are used to segment the cases.\n\nCases in which the variables have similar values are grouped into *clusters* in an attempt to find homogenous subsets. Determining the number of clusters to create is part of the challenge of such techniques. Since clustering is exploratory in nature, the resulting clusters are not necessarily right or wrong. Instead, cluster solutions should be judged by their ability to address the specific business problem you are trying to solve. Applications of cluster analysis include:\n\n- Market research\n- Plant and animal ecology\n- Medical imaging (e.g., PET Scans)\n- Service/product usage pattern identification\n- Social network analysis\n- Crime analysis\n- Anomaly detection\n\n# **Association Modeling**\n\nCompanies like Amazon and Netflix have made *association modeling* commonplace. As consumers, most of us have encountered recommendation engines where a movie is recommended based upon our prior viewing habits or books are recommended based on our prior purchases (or even just our prior browsing behavior). **Association models use transactional data to predict future transactions.** The idea is that you may be able to suggest additional items that a person may want or need based on their previous buying behavior. This results in statements such as, “People who bought product A and product B might also like product C” appearing on their computer screens.\n\nAssociation modeling is often described primarily as a kind of market basket analysis, but while it is strongly associated with retail data, it can also be applied in other areas. For example, in predictive maintenance, a pair of part failures might frequently be associated with the failure of a third part even though that third part doesn’t show evidence of trouble at the time the first two fail.\n\n**Transactions in association models often occur at the same time.** For instance, many items might be listed on a grocery store receipt, but, there is no indication of which purchases occurred before others. Hot dogs and hot dog buns may be frequently purchased together, but there is no “rule” that indicates which purchase occurred first. In a predictive model, you might say that hot dogs “predict” buns or that buns predict hot dogs. A further refinement involves ***sequence analysis***, which does take into consideration the order in which events, such as purchases, occur. This can be useful in predictive maintenance or in web mining, where it might be beneficial to know the sequence in which website visitors click on links and buttons on a page or move to other pages in the site.\n\nApplications of association modeling include:\n\n- Market basket analysis\n- Retail data analysis\n- Web usage \n- Insurance claim analysis\n- Service usage\n- Medical procedures\n\n# **Overview of Predictive Models**\n\nThis course covers only some of the most popular predictive models. Specifically, we’ll take a look at the following:\n\n- Statistical models\n- Decision Tree models\n- Machine Learning models\n\n## Statistical Models\n\n***Statistical models* produce equations and *statistical tests* guide predictor selection. These models make certain assumptions whereas *rule induction* and *machine learning* models do not.** Here are several characteristics of statistical predictive models:\n\n- Predictions are expressed as equations.\n- Equations allow users to see the effect of a one-unit change on any field and how this change impacts the outcome variable.\n- Predictive models are based on statistical theory, which involves developing hypotheses and assessing statistical significance. This allows you to easily identify the important variables.\n- Predictive models involve assumptions about the data, which may limit the situations in which some models can be used.\n\nBelow is a list of some statistical models.\n\n- Logistic Regression\n- Discriminant Analysis\n- Linear Regression\n- Generalized Linear Models\n- Cox Regression\n- Time Series\n\n## Decision Tree Models\n\nA *decision tree* or *rule induction model* is an important type of predictive model. It derives a set of rules in relation to a dependent variable. The model’s output shows the reasoning for each rule and can therefore be used to understand the decision-making process that drives a particular outcome. Models that produce decision trees belong to this class of models. Generally, decision tree predictive models:\n\n- Create segments that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (identify homogeneous subgroups)\n- Create rules for making predictions about individual cases\n- Can easily handle a large number of predictors\n- Can account for interaction and non-linear relationships\n- Have few assumptions\n- Can create overly complex models that over-fit data (does not generalize)\n\nBelow is a list of several rule induction models:\n\n- CHAID\n- CART\n- C5.0\n- QUEST\n- Decision List\n- MARS\n\n## Machine Learning Models\n\n*Machine learning models* are optimized for learning complex patterns. Unlike traditional statistical techniques, no assumptions are made about the data. Machine learning models do not produce a set of rules like rule induction models, nor do they produce easy-to-understand equations like statistical models. Thus, machine learning models are often said to be “black box” models. They produce a set of equations, but because there is a hidden layer (possibly several hidden layers), the interpretation of the coefficient weights is not straightforward as it is with traditional statistical models or rule induction models. Machine learning predictive models:\n\n- Are optimized for learning complex patterns\n- Can account for interaction and non-linear relationships\n- Have few assumptions \n- Are essentially “black box” models—their interpretation is not straight-forward\n- Are used for predictive accuracy but not for understanding the mechanics behind a prediction\n\nBelow is a list of several machine learning models:\n\n- Neural Networks\n- Support Vector Machines\n- Random Forest\n- Naïve Bayesian Algorithms\n- Gradient Boosting Algorithms\n- K-Nearest Neighbors\n\n# **Model Validation**\n\nThe process of statistical hypothesis testing, which involves a result’s statistical significance in the context of certain data distribution assumptions (such as having normally distributed errors), helps us determine when we have found a valid and reliable result. However, most data-mining methods do not depend on specific data distribution assumptions for drawing inferences from the sample to the population. So how is validation achieved? Model validation in data mining is usually done by partitioning the data into training and testing datasets. Models are developed from the training data and then the models’ predictions are tested on the testing data. Validity is established by demonstrating that the model applies to data different from what was used to derive the model. Statisticians often recommend such validation for statistical models, but it is crucial for more general (less distribution-bound) data-mining techniques.\n\n# **How to Choose a Model**\n\nChoosing a model is difficult. Obviously, if you have a variable in the data file that you want to predict, then any of the predictive models (depending on the target variable’s level of measurement) will perform the task albeit with varying degrees of success. If you want to find groups of individuals that behave similarly on a number of fields in the data, then any of the clustering methods are appropriate. The use of association rules, while not directly giving you the ability to make predictions, are extremely useful as a tool for understanding the various patterns within the data.\n\nHowever, determining which particular prediction technique will work best depends specifically on how the variables you want to predict are related to the predictors. There are suggested guidelines as to when one technique may work better than another, but these are only suggestions and not rules.\n\nFrom the previous discussion, it follows that more than one prediction model can be used to predict an outcome. The business context provides the first deciding factor in selecting a model. For example, if your goal is to extract a set of rules from the model, a rul*e induction model* is the only choice. Alternatively, if the model itself is of no interest but must nevertheless be as accurate as possible, then any of the models could be a candidate for the task. When one class of model is preferred but there are many models within that class, how do you choose a specific model?\n\nEach model has different characteristics when it comes to they way in which:\n\n- Missing values are handled\n- Continuous predictors are handled\n- Categorical predictors are handled\n- Outliers are handled\n- The number of predictors impacts prediction\n- The model scores data\n\nThere are many subtle differences between the models. In the end, however, it is always the business users who balance the pros and cons, and decide which model or combination of models should be used. There is a wide range of possibilities and it is only the business user who can decide what to do.\n\nData analytics and reporting tools such as KNIME provide for simplicity in building models. Machine learning models, rule induction models (decision trees), and statistical models can be built with great ease and speed, and their results compared. You must remember that data mining is an iterative process: models will be built, broken down, and often even combined before the user is satisfied with the results.\n\nOne final yet important point to keep in mind when building models is that software will only find rules or patterns in data if they actually exist. You cannot extract a model with high predictive accuracy if there are no associations between the predictors and dependent variables.\n\n# **Reference** \n\n**Course text:** UCI. (2020).

The useful information often consists of patterns and relationships in the data that were **previously unknown or even unsuspected**.\n\nA common misconception is that data mining involves passing huge amounts of data through intelligent technologies that find patterns and give magical solutions to business problems. This is not true, although data mining does involve more automation than one typically finds in traditional statistical analyses.\n\n**Data mining is an interactive and iterative process.** Business expertise must be used together with advanced technologies to identify underlying relationships and features in the data. A seemingly useless pattern in data discovered by data mining can often be transformed into a valuable piece of actionable information using business experience and expertise.\n\nMany of the techniques used in data mining are referred to as ***modeling*** and require a different approach for model generation and testing compared to standard, traditional statistics. While **traditional statistics focuses on probabilities and hypothesis** testing using data-specific research, **data mining focuses on using historical data** accumulated during the normal course of business. It is then the responsibility of the data miner to select, prepare, and analyze the data to determine whether it is acceptable and likely to generalize to the population of interest. Due to the typically large files involved and the weak assumptions made about the distribution of the data, **data mining tends to be less focused on statistical significance tests and more focused on practical importance.**\n\nData mining has been used in hundreds of applications, including:\n\n- Detecting fraudulent financial activity;\n- Identifying specific purchases that are more likely to lead to additional purchases;\n- Classifying customers into groups based on distinct purchase or usage patterns; and\n- Predicting which page a website visitor will visit next.\n\n# **The Art and Practice of Data Mining**\n\nThis is the definition that Keith McCormick has previously used in books and presentations. \n\n> *Data mining is the selection and analysis of data accumulated during the normal course of business. The goal is to find (and confirm) previously unknown relationships that can be used to develop predictive models that, when applied to new data, can produce valuable insight for making business decisions. Several points are worth emphasizing:*\n>\n> - *The data is not new.*\n> - *The data is not collected solely to perform data mining.*\n> - *The data miner is not testing known relationships (neither hypotheses nor hunches) against the data.*\n> - *The patterns must be verifiable.*\n> - *The resulting models must be capable of something useful.*\n> - *The resulting models must actually work when deployed on new data.*\t\n\nFor additional information on data mining, please visit [https://keithmccormick.com/data mining-defined/](https://keithmccormick.com/data-mining-defined/)\n\n# **Introducing CRISP-DM**\n\nThe typical data mining process can become complicated very quickly. There is much to keep track of—complex business problems, multiple data sources, varying data quality across data sources, an array of data mining techniques, different ways of measuring data mining success, and so on. To stay on track, it helps to have an explicitly defined process model for data mining that can guide you through critical issues and ensure that important points are addressed. This process model can serve as a data mining road map that helps you stay on course as you dig into the complexities of the data.\n\nThe data mining process model we recommend is the ***CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining* (CRISP-DM)**, which is considered the de facto standard for conducting a data mining project. As you can tell from the name, this model is designed as a general model that can be applied to a wide variety of business problems in just about any industry. The model includes six phases starting with *business understanding*.\n\n![image-20230223173559821](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223173559821.png)\n\n![image-20230223173655160](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223173655160.png)\n\n## Business Understanding\n\nThe business objectives and question(s) to be answered, and formulating a concrete plan for proceeding through the data mining process. You need to:\n\n- Identify business objectives and success criteria;\n- Perform a situational assessment (resources, constraints, assumptions, risks, costs, and benefits);\n- Determine the goals of the data mining project;\n- Identify success criteria; and\n- Produce a project plan.\n\n## Data Understanding\n\nOnce the business understanding phase is complete, you’re ready to begin collecting data and associated relevant information (such as the source of the data and the manner in which it was collected) for use in the project. It is also crucial to meet with subject matter experts (SMEs) to review what you have been collecting to ensure completeness (i.e., that no necessary data is missing) and verify your understanding of the data. It is also important to discuss the data in the context of the business problem you’re addressing. Sometimes, it may be necessary to return to the business understanding phase before proceeding.\n\nWith data in hand, you can begin exploring it and becoming thoroughly familiar with its characteristics. For each field in your dataset, you should review **the distribution, range (for continuous fields), outliers, anomalies, and missing values (type and amount)**. You can also begin looking for obvious, interesting patterns in the data such as relationships between a predictor and a target field. You’ll need to:\n\n- Understand your data resources;\n- Know the characteristics of the data;\n- Describe the data;\n- Explore the data; and\n- Verify data quality.\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nAfter cataloging your data resources, it’s time to prepare your data for mining. Data preparation is by far the most time-consuming step in the data mining process. **Various estimates suggest that 70% to 90% of the time spent on a data mining project is allocated to data preparation;** this is because you are using data that was collected for other reasons (for normal business operations, not for data mining). Preparations include:\n\n- Selecting data;\n- Cleaning data;\n- Constructing data;\n- Integrating data; and\n- Formatting data.\n\nThese tasks will likely be performed multiple times and not in any prescribed order. They can be very time-consuming but are critical for the success of the data mining project. In particular, data construction is a critical aspect of data preparation. Models work much better when the variables have been adjusted (e.g., by creating ratios, determining change scores, and calculating total scores) to make patterns appear more clearly. \n\n## Modeling\n\n![image-20230223173722789](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20230223173722789.png)\n\nOnce you have prepared the data, you are ready for modeling, which involves sophisticated analytical methods that can extract information from the data. This phase involves:\n\n- Selecting the modeling technique;\n- Generating a test design;\n- Building the model; and\n- Assessing the model.\n- Validation\n  - Split the data\n    - Training: Build the model\n    - Testing: Test the model with testing dataset and compare the results with observed data\n\nDeveloping a model is an iterative process and you can expect to try several models and modeling techniques before finding the best one. **One feature that separates data mining from other approaches is the use of multiple models to make predictions, building on the strengths of each technique.**\n\nAn important part of model development is ***validating*** the model’s predictive capability. Briefly, the process involves dividing your dataset into two parts: **a *training dataset* and a *testing dataset***. You develop your model using the training data and then test it by making predictions using the testing data. If the predictions made using the two datasets are in agreement, you can begin applying the model to new data. In summary, you conclude that the model is valid by demonstrating that it applies to (fits) a dataset that is independent of the one used in the model’s derivation. Statisticians often recommend such validation for statistical models, generally, but it is especially important when employing data mining techniques. \n\n## Evaluation\n\nOnce you have chosen your models, you are ready to **evaluate how the data mining results can help you achieve your business objectives**. At this stage of the project, you have built one or more models that appear to be of high quality from a data analysis perspective. Before writing final reports and deploying the model, however, it is important to more thoroughly evaluate the model and review the steps taken in constructing the model so you can be certain it properly achieves your business objectives. A key aim is to determine if there are any important business issues that have not been sufficiently considered. At the end of this phase, a decision will be made on the use of the data mining results. The evaluation phase tasks are:\n\n- Evaluate results;\n- Review the process; and\n- Determine the next steps.\n\nEvaluation is frequently confused with *model **assessment***—the last task of the modeling phase. **Assessing the model focuses on the “data analysis perspective”** **and includes metrics like model accuracy and stability.** The authors of CRISP-DM considered calling this phase *business evaluation* because it has to be conducted in the language of the business using the metrics of the business as indicators of success. The value of a predictive model arises in two ways (Khabaza, 2010):\n\n1. The model’s predictions lead to improved (more effective) action; and\n2. The model delivers insight (new knowledge), which leads to improved strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that the value of a predictive model is not determined by any technical measure. Data miners should *not* focus on predictive accuracy, model stability, or any other technical metric for predictive models at the expense of business insight and business fit.\n\n## Deployment\n\nDepending on the business requirements, deployment can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data mining process. **Keep in mind that creating the model is generally not the end of the project.** Even if the purpose of the model is only to increase one’s knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained will need to be organized and presented in a way that the organization can use for decision-making. So in essentially all projects, a final report will need to be produced and distributed.\n\n**Most critical is the deployment of the model to make predictions or create scores against new data.** This might be relatively simple if done within the data mining software you used, or more complex if the model is to be applied directly against an existing database. Whatever the case, a plan should be developed to monitor the model’s predictions and success in order to verify that the model is still valid.\n\nIn many projects, It is not unusual for the deployment team to be different from the modeling team; in some situations deployment may be the responsibility of team members having more of an IT focus. The tasks in the deployment phase are:\n\n- Plan the deployment;\n- Plan monitoring and maintenance activities;\n- Produce a final report; and\n- Review the project.\n\nSee also[ https://keithmccormick.com/crispdm](https://keithmccormick.com/crispdm) for additional information about CRISP-DM.\n\n# **Reference**\n\n**Course text:** UCI.

**1 信息量**\n首先是信息量。假设我们听到了两件事，分别如下：\n\n> 事件A：巴西队进入了2018世界杯决赛圈。\n> 事件B：中国队进入了2018世界杯决赛圈。\n\n仅凭直觉来说，显而易见事件B的信息量比事件A的信息量要大。究其原因，是因为事件A发生的概率很大，事件B发生的概率很小。所以当越不可能的事件发生了，我们获取到的信息量就越大。越可能发生的事件发生了，我们获取到的信息量就越小。那么信息量应该和事件发生的概率有关。\n\n假设$X$是一个离散型随机变量，其取值集合为$x$,概率分布函数 $p(x)=Pr(X=x)$, $x∈χ$则定义事件$X=x_0$的信息量为：\n\n$$\nI(x_0)=−log(p(x_0))\n$$\n\n由于是概率所以$p(x_0)$的取值范围是 $[0,1]$,绘制为图形如下，可见该函数符合我们对信息量的直觉。\n\n![image-20221111062251336](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/image-20221111062251336.png)\n\n# **2 熵**\n\n考虑另一个问题，对于某个事件，有$n$种可能性，每一种可能性都有一个概率$p(xi)$\n这样就可以计算出某一种可能性的信息量。举一个例子，假设你拿出了你的电脑，按下开关，会有三种可能性，下表列出了每一种可能的概率及其对应的信息量\n\n| 序号 | 事件         | 概率 $p$ | 信息量 $I$         |\n| ---- | ------------ | ----- | ------------------- |\n| A    | 电脑正常开机 | 0.7   | $-log(p(A))=0.36$   |\n| B    | 电脑无法开机 | 0.2   | $-log(p(B))=1.61$ |\n| C    | 电脑爆炸了   | 0.1   | $-log(p(C))=2.30$ |\n\n> 注：文中的对数均为自然对数\n\n我们现在有了信息量的定义，而熵用来表示所有信息量的期望，即：\n\n$$\nH(X)=−\\sum_{i=1}^np(x_i)log(p(x_i))\n$$\n\n其中$n$代表所有的$n$种可能性，所以上面的问题结果就是\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(X) &= −[p(A)log(p(A))+p(B)log(p(B))+p(C))log(p(C))]\n\\\\&= 0.7×0.36+0.2×1.61+0.1×2.30\n\\\\&= 0.804\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n然而有一类比较特殊的问题，比如投掷硬币只有两种可能，字朝上或花朝上。买彩票只有两种可能，中奖或不中奖。我们称之为0-1分布问题（二项分布的特例），对于这类问题，熵的计算方法可以简化为如下算式：\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(X)&=−\\sum_{i=1}^np(xi)log(p(xi))\\\\\n&=−p(x)log(p(x))−(1−p(x))log(1−p(x))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n# **3 相对熵（KL散度）**\n相对熵又称KL散度,如果我们对于同一个随机变量 $ x $ 有两个单独的概率分布 $ P(x) $ 和 $ Q(x)$ ，我们可以使用 KL 散度（Kullback-Leibler divergence）来衡量这两个分布的差异\n\n> 维基百科对相对熵的定义\n> In the context of machine learning, $D_{KL}(p‖q) $ is often called the information gain achieved if $P$ is used instead of $Q$.\n\n即如果用 $P$ 来描述目标问题，而不是用  $ Q$  来描述目标问题，得到的信息增量。\n\n在机器学习中，$P$ 往往用来表示样本的真实分布，比如 $[1,0,0]$ 表示当前样本属于第一类。$Q$ 用来表示模型所预测的分布，比如 $[0.7,0.2,0.1]$\n\n直观的理解就是如果用 $P$ 来描述样本，那么就非常完美。而用 $Q$ 来描述样本，虽然可以大致描述，但是不是那么的完美，信息量不足，需要额外的一些“信息增量”才能达到和 $P$ 一样完美的描述。如果我们的 $Q$ 通过反复训练，也能完美的描述样本，那么就不再需要额外的“信息增量”， $Q$ 等价于$P$。\n\nKL散度的计算公式：\n\n$$\nD_{KL}(p||q)=\\sum_{i=1}^np(x_i)log(\\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)})\n$$\n\n$n$ 为事件的所有可能性。\n\n$D_{KL}$的值越小，表示 $P$ 分布和 $Q$ 分布越接近\n\n# **4 交叉熵**\n对式*KL散度的计算公式*变形可以得到：\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{KL}(p||q)&=\\sum_{i=1}^np(xi)log(p(xi))−\\sum_{i=1}^np(xi)log(q(xi))\\\\\n&=−H(p(x))+[−\\sum_{i=1}^np(xi)log(q(xi))]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n等式的前一部分恰巧就是 $p$ 的熵，等式的后一部分，就是交叉熵：\n\n$$\nH(p,q)=−\\sum_{i=1}^np(xi)log(q(xi))\n$$\n\n在机器学习中，我们需要评估 `label` 和 `predicts` 之间的差距，使用KL散度刚刚好，即 $D_{KL}(y||\\hat{y})$，由于KL散度中的前一部分 $−H(y)$ 不变，故在优化过程中，只需要关注交叉熵就可以了。所以一般在机器学习中直接用用交叉熵做`loss`，评估模型。\n\n# **5 机器学习中交叉熵的应用**\n\n## 5.1 为什么要用交叉熵做loss函数？\n\n在线性回归问题中，常常使用MSE（Mean Squared Error）作为loss函数，比如：\n\n$$\nloss=\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m(y_i−\\hat{y_i})^2\n$$\n\n这里的 $ m $  表示  $ m $ 个样本的， $ loss $ 为 $ m $ 个样本的 $ loss $ 均值。\n\nMSE在线性回归问题中比较好用，那么在逻辑分类问题中还是如此么？\n\n## 5.2 交叉熵在单分类问题中的使用\n这里的单类别是指，每一张图像样本只能有一个类别，比如只能是狗或只能是猫。\n\n交叉熵在单分类问题上基本是标配的方法\n\n$$\nloss=−\\sum_{i=1}^ny_ilog(\\hat{y_i})\n$$\n\n上式为一张样本的  $ loss  $ 计算方法。式中 $ n  $ 代表着 $ n $ 种类别。\n\n举例说明，比如有如下样本：\n\n![SouthEast-16489642743263](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/SouthEast-16489642743263.png)\n\n对应的标签和预测值\n\n|       | 猫   | 青蛙 | 老鼠 |\n| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Label | 0    | 1    | 0    |\n| Pred  | 0.3  | 0.6  | 0.1  |\n\n那么\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nloss&=−(0×log(0.3)+1×log(0.6)+0×log(0.1)\\\\&=−log(0.6)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n对应一个batch的 $ loss $ 就是\n\n$$\nloss=−\\frac1m\\sum_{j=1}^m\\sum_{i=1}^ny_{ji}log(\\hat{y_{ji}})\n$$\n\n $ m $ 为当前 $ batch $ 的样本数\n\n## 5.3 交叉熵在多分类问题中的使用\n\n这里的多类别是指，每一张图像样本可以有多个类别，比如同时包含一只猫和一只狗\n\n和单分类问题的标签不同，多分类的标签是**n-hot**。\n\n比如下面这张样本图，即有青蛙，又有老鼠，所以是一个多分类问题。\n\n![SouthEast-16489643649396](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Jiayi-Zeng.github.io/pic/img/SouthEast-16489643649396.png)\n\n对应的标签和预测值：\n\n|       | 猫   | 青蛙 | 老鼠 |\n| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Label | 0    | 1    | 1    |\n| Pred  | 0.1  | 0.7  | 0.8  |\n\n\n值得注意的是，这里的 `Pred` 不再是通过 `softmax` 计算的了，这里采用的是**sigmoid**。将每一个节点的输出归一化到 $ [0,1] $ 之间。所有 `Pred` 值的和也不再为1。换句话说，就是每一个 `Label` 都是独立分布的，相互之间没有影响。所以交叉熵在这里是单独对每一个节点进行计算，每一个节点只有两种可能值，所以是一个二项分布。前面说过对于二项分布这种特殊的分布，熵的计算可以进行简化。\n\n同样的，交叉熵的计算也可以简化，即\n\n$$\nloss=−ylog(\\hat{y})−(1−y)log(1−\\hat{y})\n$$\n\n注意，上式只是针对一个节点的计算公式。这一点一定要和单分类 $ loss $ 区分开来。\n\n例子中可以计算为：\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nloss_{cat}&=−0×log(0.1)−(1−0)log(1−0.1)=−log(0.9)\\\\\nloss_{frog}&=−1×log(0.7)−(1−1)log(1−0.7)=−log(0.7)\\\\\nloss_{mouse}&=−1×log(0.8)−(1−1)log(1−0.8)=−log(0.8)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n单张样本的

前言**\n\n通俗讲，**渲染**（Render)是处理器将需要计算的画面信息，计算并“绘制”在显示屏幕上的过程。随着显示技术的进步，渲染技术也慢慢地出现了两条主流分支：一种用于视频游戏技术，另一种则是用于影视技术。这两类需求对应的渲染技术分别为：**实时渲染与离线渲染**。\n\n**实时渲染**（Real-time rendering）指的是在计算机上快速生成图像。它是计算机图形学中最具交互性的领域。首先一幅图像显示在屏幕上，然后观察者做出动作与反应，并且其动作反馈会影响接下来的生成内容。由于这种反馈、渲染的循环速度足够快，观察者就不会只看到独立的图像，而是会沉浸在这种动态过程中。\n\n由于追求高分辨率和高帧率的真实性体验，RTR技术难度呈指数型上升。显示设备的更新换代以及物理着色、光线追踪、精确物理引擎、更高质量的纹理模型的实现使最新一代 GPU 也难以在不影响帧率的情况下以原始分辨率渲染图像。此时，**低分辨率的性能开销实现高分辨率的画面**成为大势所趋。\n\n<center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\"

抗锯齿技术\n\n**Aliasing**（锯齿）这个术语最早出现在信号处理这门学科中，指的是当一个连续信号被采样后和其他非一致信号混淆的现象。在3D渲染中，这个术语有着更特殊的意思——它涵盖了所有3D渲染光栅化后产生的画面瑕疵。3D场景渲染在光栅化之前是连续信号，但在进行像素渲染（对每个像素生成相应的色彩值）的时候就不得不对连续信号进行采样以获得能够输出到显示器的结果。反锯齿的目标就在于让最终输出的画面和原生场景尽可能接近，修复渲染瑕疵。\n\n**所有的渲染失真都可以归因于采样问题**（用有限的像素展示无限的细节），使用哪种反锯齿手段与锯齿成因息息相关。因此，为了探讨不同反锯齿手段的优势和劣势，我们先将3D渲染的瑕疵根据其成因简单归纳为6个类别：**几何失真、透明失真、子像素失真、纹理失真、渲染失真、闪烁情形（时间性锯齿）**。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

   <div style=\"color: #999;\">图 3 各种类型的失真。分别为：<br>透明失真、几何失真（2D）、子像素失真、<br>几何失真（3D）、纹理失真、渲染失真</div>\n</center>\n\n现如今的抗锯齿技术可以分为两类：**一类是通过提高采样质量来减少渲染时锯齿，另一类则是通过对已渲染好的图片分析和后处理来减少锯齿。**\n\n### 2.1.1 基于采样的抗锯齿技术\n\n首先讨论基于采样的反锯齿技术，其实质则是通过渲染比屏幕分辨率更高的画面而后再降采样至屏幕空间分辨率。样本数量，样本位置、采样模式和样本融合方式都会影响最终的画面质量。\n\n#### 样本数量\n\n显而易见，倘若生成一个像素的采样点趋近于无穷多，那么最终的效果就会无限趋近“完美”的光栅化效果。因此，抗锯齿的效果和样本数量密切相关。当然样本数量也关系到设备性能：通常在游戏中每个像素会使用2个或4个采样点，而在高端显示器中可能会使用到8个及以上的采样点。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n

   <div style=\"color: #999;\">图 4 三角形光栅化，每个像素有4个有序样本</div>\n</center>\n\n#### 样本位置\n\n1. **顺序栅格超级采样 (Ordered Grid Super-Sampling，OGSS)**\n\n样本位置的选取对最终画面质量有着至关重要的影响。特别是在游戏渲染中，由于采样点数量少，样本位置就更为重要。由于样本位置呈有序点排列，这种抗锯齿也被称作顺序栅格超级采样。\n\n2. **旋转栅格超级采样 (Rotated Grid Super-Sampling，RGSS)**\n\n然而，对于接近垂直或接近水平的线而言，使用排列有序的采样网格效果往往不佳。此时，采用旋转栅格超级采样可以获得更好的结果。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px

   <div style=\"color: #999;\">图 5 近垂直线场景、完美抗锯齿光栅化、4个有序样本的光栅化、4个稀疏栅格样本的抗锯齿</div>\n</center> \n\n为了缓解这个问题，我们也可以将采样点稀疏摆放在不同的列。对于抗锯齿来说，理想的摆放应当是稀疏的。换句话说，对于N个采样点，任意两个采样点不会在一个$N\\times N$网格的同一列、行以及对角线上。通过对N皇后问题求解可得到满足这种条件的采样点摆放方式，在此不再赘述。这种稀疏摆放采样点的抗锯齿也被称作**稀疏栅格抗锯齿（Sparse Grid Anti-aliasing，SGAA）**。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0

   <div style=\"color: #999;\">图 6  左图：有序采样点 右图：N皇后采样</div>\n</center> \n\n#### 采样类型\n\n1. **超采样抗锯齿（Super-sampling Anti-aliasing，SSAA）**\n\n   基于采样的抗锯齿方法对每个采样点都进行了运算。虽然这样的采样方式可以消除各类渲染失真，但也非常耗费资源。举个例子，N倍采样将会给像素渲染、光栅单元、内存带宽以及内存容量施加N倍的计算压力。这种对每个采样点都进行独立计算的采样也被称为超采样抗锯齿。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0

Buffer）中的数据进行超级采样抗锯齿的处理。可以理解为只对边缘进行抗锯齿处理。当硬件支持Z缓存和模板缓存时（而现今大部分GPU都已经支持这些特性），MSAA带来的内存带宽开销会进一步缩小。相比SSAA对画面中所有数据进行处理，MSAA大大减弱对资源的消耗。但由于MSAA仅针对几何体边缘进行抗锯齿，其他类别的失真（透明失真、纹理失真和渲染失真等）都无法被消除。\n\n <center>\n

Sample)。简单说 CSAA 就是将边缘多边形里需要取样的子像素坐标覆盖掉，把原像素坐标强制安置在硬件和驱动程序预先算好的坐标中。这就好比取样标准统一的MSAA，能够最高效率的执行边缘取样，效能提升非常的显著。比方说16xCSAA取样性能下降幅度仅比4xMSAA略高一点，处理效果却几乎和 8xMSAA一样。8xCSAA有着4xMSAA的处理效果，性能消耗却和2xMSAA相同。\n\n

0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

Anti-Aliasing，HRAA)**\n\n一种改进的融合方法被称作高分辨率抗锯齿方法也称 Quincunx 方法，出自 NVIDIA 公司。Quincunx指的是5个物体的排列方式：其中 4 个在正方形角上，第五个在正方形中心，也就是梅花形，很像六边模型上的五点图案模式。这使得采样点个数不多的情况下的抗锯齿效果明显增强，但由于一个像素点过多地混合了周边的采样点信息而使图像边缘变得模糊，带来了画面锐度降低的问题。\n\n2. **可编程过滤抗锯齿（Custom Filter Anti-Aliasing，CFAA）**\n\n一种更灵活的方法则出现于2007年AMD的HD2900系列显卡中，其称为**Tent Filter**。HD2900系列提供了可编程的混合能力，也称为可编程过滤抗锯齿，并借这种工具实现了Narrow Tent和Wide Tent两种模式。如图9所示，这两种新型采样模式在混合采样点时并没有使用相同权重，而是根据采样点离像素中心的距离决定相应的混合权重。Narrow和Wide两种混合模式的区别仅在于其使用的过滤核心(Filter Kernel)的大小上。这种混合模式可以根据需要使用不同样本数量。相较于Quincunx方法，这种抗锯齿模式可以说是平衡了画面锐度和抗锯齿力度。\n\n<center>\n   <img

后处理抗锯齿技术\n\n虽然基于采样的抗锯齿算法不仅原理简单，在采样点足够的情况下也有很优秀的效果，但在性能方面仍然会带来巨大的开销。此外基于采样的抗锯齿在近期流行的渲染模式中（例如延迟渲染）基于各种原因更难被实现。由此诞生了另一种非基于采样的抗锯齿方法——后处理抗锯齿。这个方法渲染出未使用抗锯齿的原生画面（无任何采样和缩放），随后尝试通过对成品画面的分析来减少锯齿和失真。\n\n总体而言，所有的后处理抗锯齿都包含了以下三个步骤，而不同的后处理抗锯齿主要区别就在这三个步骤的具体实现方法上。\n\n1. **检测图像中不连续的部分，即检测边缘信息**\n2. **通过这些不连续部分的信息重建原始边缘信息**\n3. **对估测边缘上的像素进行重着色**\n\n**形态抗锯齿（Morphological Anti-Aliasing，简称 MLAA）**，是 AMD 推出的完全基于 CPU 处理的抗锯齿解决方案。例如图10展示了MLAA对边缘的识别和重建方式。左侧是走样图像。我们的目的是确定边缘的可能方向。中间图展示了算法通过检查相邻像素来记录其为边缘的可能性，图中显示了两个可能的边缘位置。右侧图则展示使用了最佳的推测边缘后，将相邻的颜色与估计的覆盖率成比例地混合到中心像素中。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius:

style=\"color: #999;\">图 14 左图：MLAA 模式及其重建边缘，右图：MLAA 中使用的不连续模式</div></center> \n\n### 2.1.3 混合抗锯齿算法\n\n了解了两大类抗锯齿技术方向后，我们会去思考现有流行的抗锯齿技术是如何弥补传统算法的遗憾。\n\n**一种可行的解决方案是将基于采样的抗锯齿算法和后期处理抗锯齿技术结合起来。**这种新的混合抗锯齿算法在对画面进行多次采样的同时，会结合后期处理抗锯齿算法以输出最终画面。这样做的好处是显而易见的：新算法既避免了纯后期处理抗锯齿的种种缺点(比如说不能处理子像素失真和造成边缘闪烁的问题)，在同样的性能损失下，对于几何失真的处理结果又比纯粹基于采样的抗锯齿算法好得多。\n\n1. **快速近似抗锯齿（Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing，FXAA）**\n\n  快速近似抗锯齿是传统 MSAA效果的一种高性能近似。它是一种单程像素着色器，和 MLAA一样运行于目标游戏渲染管线的后期处理阶段，但不像后者那样使用 DirectCompute，而只是单纯的后期处理着色器，不依赖于任何GPU计算 API。正因为如此，FXAA技术对显卡没有特殊要求，完全兼容 NVIDIA、AMD 的不同显卡(MLAA仅支持AMD)和 DirectX 9.0、DirectX 10、DirectX 11。\n\n2. **时间性抗锯齿（Temporal Anti-Aliasing，TXAA）**\n\n  时间性抗锯齿将MSAA、时间滤波以及后期处理相结合，用于呈现更高的视觉保真度。与CG电影中所采用的技术类似，TXAA集MSAA的强大功能与复杂的解析滤镜于一身，可呈现出更加平滑的图像效果。此外，TXAA还能够对帧之间的整个场景进行抖动采样，以减少闪烁情形（时间性锯齿）。目前，TXAA有两种模式：TXAA 2X和 TXAA 4X。TXAA 2X可提供堪比8X MSAA的视觉保真度，然而所需性能却与 2X MSAA相类似；TXAA4X的图像保真度胜过8XMSAA，所需性能仅仅与4X MSAA相当。\n\n3. **多帧采样抗锯齿（Multi-Frame Sampled Anti-Aliasing，MFAA）**\n\n  多帧采样抗锯齿（Multi-Frame Sampled Anti-Aliasing，MFAA）是NVIDIA公司根据MSAA 改进出的一种抗锯齿技术。目前仅搭载Maxwell架构GPU的显卡才能使用。可以将MFAA理解为MSAA的优化版，能够在得到几乎相同效果的同时提升性能上的表现。MFAA与MSAA最大的差别就在于在同样开启4倍效果的时候MSAA是真正的针对每个边缘像素周围的 4 个像素进行采样，MFAA则是仅仅只是采用交错的方式采样边缘某个像素周围的两个像素。\n\n另一种可行的方案还未被广泛应用：**在渲染时记录额外的几何信息，以供后处理抗锯齿使用。**目前的实现有GPAA (Geometric Post-process Anti-Aliasing) 以及GBAA(Geometry Buffer Anti-Aliasing)等。\n\n## 2.2 超分辨率技术\n\n图像分辨率体现了系统实际所能反映物体细节信息的能力。相较于低分辨率图像，高分辨率图像通常包含更大的像素密度、更丰富的纹理细节及更高的可信赖度。由此，从软件和算法的角度着手，实现图像超分辨率重建的技术成为了图像处理和计算机视觉等多个领域的热点研究课题。\n\n图像的超分辨率重建技术指的是将给定的低分辨率图像通过特定的算法恢复成相应的高分辨率图像。超分辨率方法通常分为**单帧超分辨率（Single Image Superresolution，SISR）和多帧超分辨率（Multi-image Superresolution，MISR）、时域超采样（Temporal Super Sampling）**。\n\n### 2.2.1 单帧超分辨率\n\n单帧超分辨率是和DLSS非常相关的一个研究方向。尤其是跟着这两年深度学习的应用的热度，这个问题的state of the art也提高了很多，这个方向的研究也经常上国内公众号的头条，例如SRCNN，SRGAN，ESRGAN等等。\n\n可是单帧超分辨率其实是个非常困难的问题，因为本质上需要生成低分辨率图像中完全不存在的信息。用神经网络解决这一类问题，**本质上就是在训练集中学习到各种低分辨率的像素和高分辨率像素的一个对应关系。**有了这个映射后，神经网络能做到比一般的基于插值（interpolation）的方法更好的效果。\n\n<center>\n   <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n   box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

  <br><div style=\"color: #999;\">图 15 单帧超分辨率</div></center> \n\n**但尽管如此，这样生成出来的信息其实是完全基于训练集图片中的数据分布，而并不是对我们实际正在渲染的场景的采样。**所以单帧超分辨率的结果经常会和原生分辨率渲染在风格和样式上不一致。对于DLSS来说，我们的目标是重建出和高分辨率渲染一模一样的结果，所以单帧超分辨率一类的工作对实时渲染来说很难适用。\n\n### 2.2.2 多帧超分辨率\n\n另一类超采样的工作则是针对视频，或者手机摄影的多帧超分辨率。多帧超分辨率并不像单帧超分辨率那么的困难，因为我们不完全需要填补原本不存在的信息。有多个低分辨率图片的情况下，这个问题会可控很多，多帧合成的高分辨率图片往往在光学细节上的还原的质量上会比单帧超分辨率的高许多。\n\n然而针对视频或者摄影的算法也并不太能直接搬过来用于实时渲染，原因有许多。\n\n1. 在渲染中，我们可以用到的数据是比视频多很多的，我们可以计算每个像素精确的运动向量，我们也可以有场景函数的精确采样，有HDR颜色，甚至像素的精确深度。**不利用这些信息，设计出来的算法在效率和质量上都不会是最优的。**\n\n2. 许多视频超分辨率的工作是需要**用时序上未来的图片来重建当前帧的图片的**。因为实时渲染对延迟的要求，这也显然不适用。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

   <br><div style=\"color: #999;\">图 16 多帧超分辨率</div></center> \n\n### 2.2.3 时域超采样\n\n利用把渲染的样本分布在多个帧上，并且用这些多帧复合的样本重建出最终渲染的图片，这在实时渲染领域太司空见惯了。几乎所有引擎都在用的Temporal Antialiasing(TAA)，或者游戏主机上非常流行的Checkerboard Rendering都是这么一个思路。\n\n<center>\n   <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n   box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

  <br><div style=\"color: #999;\"> 图 17 棋盘渲染</div>\n</center> \n\n这一类算法利用了渲染图片的**时域连贯性（Temporal coherency）**，既渲染结果的帧与帧之间大体是连续的，发生高频变化的概率不高。也就是说，我们可以假设需要渲染的场景在上一帧和当前帧几乎一样。如果这个假设成立的话，我们大可以之间复用过去帧上对场景采样的样本来重建当前帧。\n\n<center>\n   <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n   box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n   src=\"https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/50ae89e4ff2f4e0d86364167110377af.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_d3F5LXplbmhlaQ,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBA6Zi_6bKr5piv5p2h5ZK46bG8,size_17,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16\">\n   <br><div style=\"color: #999;\">图 18 TAA</div>\n</center> \n\n这样做的好处是，每一帧的采样率非常低，所以渲染性能会有很大的提升，然而重建图像时的样本还都确实是对于场景函数的无偏采样，所以最终重建的图像质量也会和原生分辨率渲染非常一致。\n\n然而天下哪有这等好事，实时渲染或者游戏的图片序列中几乎每一帧都有或多或少的变化，从角色动画，到动态光影，到粒子特效。直接复用过去帧的样本来重建当前帧的图片会使重建的结果中产生很大的错误。**这种错误在渲染图片中会以延迟，或者鬼影（ghosting）的形式呈现出来。**这也是为什么，所有实时渲染中的时域超采样算法，例如TAA，都有非常重要的一步去“纠正”过去帧中样本的错误。\n\n<center>\n   <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n   box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

  <br><div style=\"color: #999;\">图 19 鬼影现象</div>\n</center> \n\n这一类算法需要首先检测过去帧和当前帧因为场景的变化导致的样本错误，然后在不影响画质太多的情况下，“合理”的纠正那些错误的样本。乍一看这简直是个计算机视觉问题，然而在实时渲染中这一步需要非常高效的完成。所以过去十几年，游戏开发者绞尽脑汁的发明了各种**“启发式”的方法（Heuristics）**。\n\n目前解决这个问题效果最好，也最常用的Heuristic，叫做**Neighborhood Clamping**，是Epic的Brian Karis在14年的SIGGRAPH的一个实时渲染讲座里最先提到的。思路其实很简单，就是把过去帧采样的样本的值的范围，限制在当前帧像素周围3x3大小的Local neighborhood的所有样本的值的范围内。\n\n# **3 DLSS 2.0技术介绍**\n\n## 3.1 DLSS 2.0原理与思路\n\nDLSS 2.0首先也是一个基于多帧的图像重建技术。因为我们的目标是重建出和原生渲染一致的画面，所以基于用单帧的算法去“想象”不存在的信息是不适用的。\n\n那DLSS 2.0和现有的实时渲染中的时域超采样有什么区别呢？DLSS 2.0抛弃了人肉手调的启发式算法，用一个在超级计算机上数万张超高质量图片训练的神经网络来代替这些Heuristics。就像深度学习在几年前在计算机视觉领域超越了各种手调的特征提取算法一样，深度学习第一次在实时渲染中也非常合理的跑赢了图形领域的手调算法。\n\n用DLSS 2.0重建的渲染图像序列达到了非常高的多帧样本利用率，这也是为什么只用四分之一的样本就可以重建出媲美原生分辨率渲染的图像质量的原因。\n\n<center>\n   <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n   box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0

rendering简单。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

2.0是一个融合了抗锯齿和超采样的算法**。引擎现有的抗锯齿解决方案例如TAA需要被移除，然后DLSS需要被插入在后处理（post processing）之前，这样后处理可以处理抗锯齿后的平滑图片以避免各种artifact。\n\nDLSS的输出会是一个高分辨率的图片，所以**引擎需要超采样后的分辨率下计算各种后处理特效**，例如景深，动态模糊，tonemapping以及渲染UI。\n\n

2.0加速渲染的原理很简单。开启DLSS后，引擎的渲染会在1/2到1/4像素的低分辨率下运行。这意味着，一大半的像素级别的计算直接被粗暴的砍掉了。像素级别的计算通常包括GBuffer的渲染，动态光源、阴影的计算，屏幕空间的特效例如屏幕空间环境遮挡（SSAO）、屏幕空间反射（SSR），甚至实时光线追踪。这些计算通常也是一帧里面最耗费性能的部分、毕竟大部分的画面出色的游戏，像素计算是绝对的瓶颈（pixel bound）。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

   <br><div style=\"color: #999;\"> 图 25 DLSS 渲染加速</div></center> \n\n\n所以DLSS 2.0的加速多少，也**直接取决于像素计算在多大程度上是性能瓶颈。**通常来说，画面越好的3A大作，越会用更加耗费性能的渲染技术，像素也就会更大程度的成为瓶颈，而DLSS则会提供更大的加速！\n\n在省掉的渲染计算之上，运行DLSS 2.0这个算法本身会引入一定的开销，这个开销通常是完全取决于分辨率大小的，不随场景内容而改变。下面这个表格展示了DLSS 2.0在不同GPU和不同分辨率下的开销。相比于DLSS 1.0，我们把这个开销减小了两倍以上。在2080Ti上，4K分辨率下也只有1.5毫秒，因为有Tensor Core的加速，这已经和普通的TAA非常接近了。\n\n <center>\n    <img

2.0可以将540p的渲染图像直接放大到1080p，或者720p到1440p，1080p到4K。并且放大的画面在质量以及细节程度完全不输原生分辨率渲染，网上的许多测评也都反映了这一点。\n\n下面放几组例子，第一个是一个几何非常密集的森林场景，开启实时光线追踪后540p原生分辨率渲染大概有89fps，但是因为分辨率太低，画面非常模糊。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

   <br><div style=\"color: #999;\"> 图 27 540p - 89fps原生渲染效果图</div></center> \n\n如果1080p渲染，画面则清晰了很多，但是帧率也降低到48fps\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

   <br><div style=\"color: #999;\">图 28 1080p – 48fps原生渲染效果图</div></center> \n\n使用DLSS2.0, 用540p分辨率渲染的画面作为输入，通过深度学习超采样至1080p，帧率提升到86fps，并且画质和原生十分接近。\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

   <br><div style=\"color: #999;\">图 29 DLSS 2.0，540p渲染输入超采样至1080p，86fps</div></center> \n\n但如果放大看的话，可以发现DLSS2.0的结果和原生1080p还是有一些差别，那么为了验证正确性，下面这个对比的左下角是每个像素用32个样本渲染的ground truth。很明显DLSS 2.0用在540p下渲染的结果，比1080p的原生渲染更接近ground truth！\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n

   <br><div style=\"color: #999;\">图 31 DLSS 2.0四大特性</div></center>\n\n1. 画质极大提升，细节和锐度媲美、甚至超越原生分辨率\n2. 4倍像素超采样（540p到1080p，1080p到4K，每4个像素中有3个是通过超采样生成）\n3. 通用模型，一个神经网络适用于所有游戏（不同引擎，着色风格，分辨率都有很强的通用性）\n4. Inference开销减半\n\n### 4.2.2 DLSS缺点\n\n1. DLSS似乎不能很好地与某些AA技术(如TSAA)一起工作，当启用这些技术时，DLSS性能会受到严重影响。\n2. 此外，由于DLSS只能工作在张量核的GPU上，所以CUDA-only和Stream处理器的gpu不能实现DLSS。\n\n## 4.2.3 DLSS技术的展望\n\n1. **更简单的 SR 网络架构**\n\n虽然 DLSR 模型在图像重建方面取得了很高的准确率和保真度，但在本地部署仍然是极其困难且耗时的。由于拥有大量的计算成本和网络训练相关参数，DLSR需要大型数据中心或超级计算机。为了解决这个问题，需要降低空间和时间复杂度，降低计算成本，减少参数数量，还需要将图像质量保持在可接受范围内。\n\n2. **更有效的算法来补偿信息丢失**\n\nDLSR 模型的主要工作原理是从低分辨率输入重建高分辨率图像。但是，以非常低的内部分辨率（例如 540p）进行渲染，或者运行非常高的放大操作时（例如从 1080p 缩放到 8K），对于重建而言，此时的缺失数据量变得太大。这通常会导致错误表达或不准确的视觉数据。为了解决这个问题，需要努力使预测算法从更少的像素中更有效地提取视觉信息。\n\n3. **专注于更广泛的实施和支持**\n\nDLSR 是一项非常新的技术，仍处于起步阶段。因此，目前只有少数应用程序提供对 DLSR 的实现支持。需要完成工作并需要构建相关的 API 以扩展对更多应用程序的支持，并且必须为开发人员创建软件工具以实现更快的增长。\n\n# **Postscript：总结**\n\n调查和攥写报告前前后后花了一周时间。前期也是随心所欲的查文献看资料写md，后期三天狂肝出小20页的报告还是相当痛苦的一件事……确实时间安排相当不合理（拖延症你又来啦），但更多的时间我认为是花费在捋思路上。在查阅资料过程中，我一直在尝试摸清内在的逻辑链——可惜思路一直被推翻重建，文章结构也一改再改，直到ddl前的最后一天的我基本满意。\n\n总体来说，收获还是相当大的，调研调查本身就是一件令人兴奋的事——可以自己思考内在联系，提出问题，再去解决……这也是我第一次看这么多的外文材料（原先对英文文献有些畏惧心理，一直没有迈出这一步，或者说没迈几步）。\n\n我最感兴趣或者最想从事的方向之一就是游戏开发（一个爱玩游戏的人也想去做游戏）。原先我多多少少低估了这个领域的难度，但现在更多地我对这个方向产生了敬畏之情。当然打动我的还有很多这个领域的前辈们。当我研究《Real time rendering》，翻看毛星云的总结提炼时，我佩服着他的热爱，也惋惜着他的离开；当我浏览文刀秋二的[知乎回答](https://www.zhihu.com/question/29504480/answer/44764493)时，我也是深深佩服的——我认为我对coding是很感兴趣的，以至于每次课设和项目我很多时间都花在学习新东西加上去，以做得好些，更好些。但当我发现大神的\"兴趣\"后，我也意识到，我还有很长的一段路要走：\n\n <center>\n    <img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\" \n    src=\"https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/41c45a32be944723964575606a6fb82d.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_d3F5LXplbmhlaQ,shadow_50,text_Q1NETiBA6Zi_6bKr5piv5p2h5ZK46bG8,size_20,color_FFFFFF,t_70,g_se,x_16\"\n    width=\"50%\">\n</center>\n\n最后再来谈谈这篇文章，个人感觉更多的还是在学习摘抄借鉴。写绪论的时候还在手敲，附引用；写抗锯齿部分的时候还能整合多份资料，翻译网站文献，再做校对；等写到DLSS时就开始复制粘贴了……总体而言，更像是多家资料的大合集，勉勉强强一个优点就是有自己的思考在内。当然，如有错误和问题，欢迎探讨。道阻且长，这是一次把报告整理至CSDN上，相信不会是最后一次！\n","tags":["DL","CG"],"categories":["Other"]}]
