[**Traffic Light Detector**](https://github.com/Jiayi-Zeng/Traffic-Light-Detector) 

Shaanxi, China, Sep 2022 - Dec 2022   

*Personal Project*             

* Based on the YOLOv4 and paired with the MobilenetV3 to lightweight the model

* Used the K-means to construct an Anchor box for the traffic lights dataset 

* Achieved results: 93.85% mAP at a real-time speed of ~56 FPS on Tesla V100, which is higher than the original YOLOv4 result: 93.59% mAP at a speed of ~47 FPS
